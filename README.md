# 🚀 Rust Cybersecurity Roadmap

Welcome to my **Rust for Cybersecurity Roadmap!** This repository tracks my progress as I learn Rust from **beginner to advanced**, 
focusing on **security applications** such as penetration testing, malware analysis, cryptography, and secure coding.

## 📌 **Learning Plan & Progress Checklist**

### ✅ **Phase 1: Rust Basics (Weeks 1-8)**
- [ ] Learn basic programming concepts (variables, functions, loops, conditionals)
- [ ] Complete [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises
- [ ] Understand Rust ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes
- [ ] Build a simple **To-Do CLI App**
- [ ] Learn error handling and Rust’s standard library

### ✅ **Phase 2: Networking & Security (Weeks 9-16)**
- [ ] Learn Rust’s networking (`std::net`, `tokio` async programming)
- [ ] Build a **basic port scanner**
- [ ] Implement a simple **TCP client & server**
- [ ] Learn Rust cryptography (`ring`, `rustls`)
- [ ] Encrypt and decrypt files using **AES encryption**
- [ ] Build a **password hashing tool**

### ✅ **Phase 3: Cybersecurity Projects (Weeks 17-32)**
- [ ] Develop a **keylogger (ethical research only)**
- [ ] Write a basic **Rust malware dropper** (test in a safe VM!)
- [ ] Build a **network sniffer** using `pcap`
- [ ] Create a **command & control (C2) framework**
- [ ] Reverse-engineer Rust binaries using **Ghidra & Radare2**

### ✅ **Phase 4: Real-World Application & Career Prep (Weeks 33-52)**
- [ ] Contribute to **Rust security open-source projects** (e.g., RustScan, RustCrypto)
- [ ] Participate in **Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions**
- [ ] Build a **Rust-based intrusion detection system (IDS)**
- [ ] Develop a **secure API with Rocket or Actix**
- [ ] Prepare for cybersecurity job applications (resume, portfolio, interview practice)
